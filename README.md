<h1 align = "center">SHANNON DUNNIGAN KIMMEL</h1>

Hi there! I work in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System as the System-Wide Monitoring (SWMP) Program Manager at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR in St. Augustine, FL. This program collects 15-minute continuous water quality and weather data and therefore, I quickly jumped into R programming in order to be able to tackle working with this data (reaching the end of an Excel spreadsheet was a *moment* for me). 

📫 How to reach me: email is best @ Shannon.Dunnigan@dep.state.fl.us Check out my [resume here.](https://github.com/skdunnigan/quarto-resume/blob/main/sdk_resume-wq.pdf)

### What am I up to?

- I am currently analyzing 20-years of monthly chlorophyll-*a* data from two long-term monitoring programs in the St. Augustine region [`gtm-chla-20yr`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/gtm-chla-20yr) using generalized additive models, mixed-meta regression analysis, and decomposition of timeseries for seasonality.

- I am recently published a manuscript analyzing six years of monthly oyster spat monitoring in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas estuary [`spat`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/spat) using generalized linear models and pairing these patterns with continuous water quality data in similar areas.
  
- I am the primary administrator for the [GTMNERR](https://github.com/GTMNERR) organization on GitHub.

- 🔬 I am integrating Quarto and GitHub with my team in our projects and helping to develop functional workflows for varying experience levels on the teams. 
   - Check out the GTMNERR SWMP quarterly report [`GTMNERR/swmp-quarter-report`](https://gtmnerr.github.io/swmp-quarter-report) or 2023 Annual Report [`GTMNERR/2023-swmp-annual-report`](https://gtmnerr.github.io/2023-swmp-annual-report) for examples.

### Experience

- 2016 - present: System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) Manager (Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR), contracted through University of North Florida.
- 2020 - 2022: Data Manager for NERRS Science Collaborative Catalyst project ["Refining techniques for high-frequency monitoring of chlorophyll in the NERRS"](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/project/Dix20). The project code is here [`chla-nerrs-catalyst`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/chla-nerrs-catalyst) and includes my first attempt at a GitHub Pages site built with R Markdown! (💃Personal achievement!)
- 2013 - 2021: Adjunct Instructor (University of North Florida)
- 2015 - 2016: Oyster Condition Assessment Field Technician (Florida Department of Environmental Protection)

### Teaching

I strive to make programming less intimidating for beginners and to help people with their R-programming and data science workflows! My favorite things to teach are data visualizations. See some of my teaching experience below:

- 2022
   - Data Visualization: a workshop I created and led on 2022 January 27-28 as part of a series of R workshops sponsored by the Gulf and Florida National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs). Materials at [`2022-01_data-viz-workshop`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/2022-01_data-viz-workshop) 
- 2021
   - R For the Infrequent UseR (virtual): a workshop I taught on 2021 September 23-24 as part of a series of R workshops sponsored by the Gulf and Florida National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs). Materials at [`2021-infrequent-useR`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/2021-infrequent-useR)
- 2020
   - Integrating R into your work with RStudio and the tidyverse (virtual): a workshop I co-taught with [Kim Cressman](https://github.com/swmpkim) that was split into four days and covered data visualization, wrangling, and basic statistical outputs on 2020 June 18-19 and 25-26 hosted by the Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR. Materials at [`2020-06_IntegrateR`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/2020-06_IntegrateR)
   - Integrating R into your work with RStudio and the tidyverse (in-person): a workshop I co-taught with [Kim Cressman](https://github.com/swmpkim) in Moss Point, MS that covered data visualization, wrangling, and basic statistical outputs on 2020 February 19-20 hosted by the Grand Bay NERR. Materials at: [`swmpkim/2020-02_GBNERR_Rworkshop`](https://github.com/swmpkim/2020-02_GBNERR_Rworkshop)
- 2019
   - The Next Step with R: Data Management, Graphics, and Functions: [Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2019 Biennial Conference](https://www.cerf.science/the-next-step-with-r-data-management-graphics-and-functions) workshop, 2019 November 3 in Mobile, AL co-taught with [Kim Cressman](https://github.com/swmpkim)

### Education

- MS (2015): Biology with Coastal Biology Focus (UNF)
- BS (2012): Biological Science with certificate in Living Marine Resources (FSU)
