<h1 align = "center">SHANNON DUNNIGAN </h1>

Hi there! I work in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System as the System-Wide Monitoring Program Manager at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR in St. Augustine, FL. This program collects 15-minute continuous water quality and weather data and therefore, I quickly jumped into R programming in order to be able to tackle working with this data (reaching the end of an Excel spreadsheet was a *moment* for me). 

### What am I up to?

- üß™ I'm currently serving as the data manager for a NERRS Science Collaborative Catalyst project, ["Refining techniques for high-frequency monitoring of chlorophyll in the NERRS"](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/project/Dix20) where I am assisting in the collection, maintenance, QAQC, and analysis of extracted chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a measured by fluorescence with Xylem YSI's Total Algae Sensor for the EXO platform. The project code is here [`chla-nerrs-catalyst`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/chla-nerrs-catalyst) and includes my first attempt at a GitHub Pages site! (üíÉPersonal achievement!)

- üë©‚Äçüè´ I also am working to compile materials for several R workshops I have or will be leading, many co-authored with [Kim Cressman](https://github.com/swmpkim) where our goal is to try to make R a little less intimidating for new and infrequent users. Giving the `bookdown` package a try!
    
- As always, I'm finding new ways to analyze and visualize our continuous water quality and weather data with the NERRs in various applications. 
   - [`GTMNERR/swmp-nut`](https://github.com/GTMNERR/swmp-nut) - a project to view nutrient data from the GTMNERR collected from 2002-present. 
   - [`guana`](https://github.com/skdunnigan/guana) - a project that produced a [Two-Year summary report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337257540_Guana_Water_Quality_Two-Year_Summary_Report_July_2017-June_2019) for a local water quality project with code used by graduate students and additional researchers. [Olivia Roorbach](https://github.com/oroorbach) are also working on a four-year report to be coming out sometime in 2021...keep an eye on it here: [`GTMNERR/guana-nut`](https://github.com/GTMNERR/guana-nut)

### Experience
